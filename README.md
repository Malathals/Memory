This project is a simple Java program built for our CSC227 course. It is used to
demonstrate managing a contiguous region memory using a fixed-size partition
scheme. It will let the users allocate and deallocate processes into a memory and will
help them understand different memory allocation approaches (First-Fit, Best-Fit,
and Worst-Fit).
